# SW3C: A fast Sliding-Window-Based Approach for DNA Sequences Compression, Comparison and Clustering
Statistical comparison methods of biological sequences based on word-counts such as k-mer, have shown great potential in minimising complexity, time and resources. These mathematical-models-based optimization often neglect biological aspects of DNA sequence which lead to an accuracy decrease. Here, we explore the potential use of a sliding-window approach for the compression, comparison and clustering of DNA sequences with optimal time and memory consumption.
